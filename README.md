# -Day-5-Mealy-FSM-and-Sequence-Detector
• Mealy Finite State Machine
• Difference between Moore and Mealy FSM
• FSM with input-based decision making
• Internal state memory (why state is not input/output)
• Immediate output response in Mealy FSM
• Sequence Detector FSM (101 pattern detection)
• Using FSM to remember past inputs
• Combining sequential (clocked) and combinational logic in FSM
• Real-world use of FSMs for pattern recognition
